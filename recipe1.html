        <h3>Shorshe Ilish was all time favorite</h3>
        <span
          >I grew up with the understanding that lish machh was a seasonal
          celebration. Which it is even now, other than some restaurants making
          it a permament feature on their menus. It was a symbol of Monsoon has
          set in.To an extent, that if it has been a rainy Friday and Sunday –
          Baba had springs in his steps to go to market on Sunday. It was
          assumed that one would get a good size, with eggs next day. Doi Ilish
          was a double celebration. If Ilish was a backhand crosscourt by
          Federer, then Doi Ilish was like enjoying that backhand at Wimbledon.
          Sorshe Ilish was Bae but still, it was a happy and good feeling.

        <h4>Bangal and Ghoti division in Shorshe Ilish too</h4>
        <span>
          There is always a healthy banter between the food and food habits of
          Epar and Opar Bangla. You will find many Bengalis with roots from
          modern Bangladesh, who prefers their Ilish not fried at all. In fact,
          in Ilish begun Jhol, which gets made in Madhushree’s house, it’s
          always sauted for a very brief time and then dropped into the begun/
          eggplant mix. In this case also, Madhushree, added her twist to the
          Shorshe Ilish. Ma used to fry this lightly but Madhushree sauted the
          fish for 3 – 4 seconds and Ma used to add red chili powder, so the
          colour was predominant mustard but there was a hint of red. I often
          wonder, if overpowering mustard kills the flavour of Ilish but rarely
          I have experienced that. For Shorshe Ilish, the wish always remains
          that more more and strong shorshe. However, Ma always used to balance
          it and Madhushree also never goes overboard. I often wonder what would
          have happened if there was no mustard.

            <span
              >Marinade the hilsa pieces with salt and 1 tsp turmeric
              powder.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>

              >Soak both the mustard seeds in half a cup of water for 15
              minutes.</span

          <li>
            <span
              >Discard the water and take the mustard seeds in a grinder jar.
              Add a couple of green chillies, 1 tbsp of mustard oil and little
              water for grinding it into a smooth paste. It takes some time to
              make a good paste and add more mustard oil or water, if required
              to make the paste.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span

              it heats, add a couple of green chillies and then nigella seeds.
              Let them splutter. Then add the rest of the turmeric powder and
              the mustard paste. While you are doing so, keep the heat to a
              medium to low.

          <li>
