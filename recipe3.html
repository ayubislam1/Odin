        <h3>RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span
              >Either grease a tray with ghee or line a tray with
              parchment/butter paper. Set aside.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Heat a nonstick pan on low heat. Add ghee, milk, and milk powder.
              Then, stir thoroughly with a spatula to combine and make sure no
              lumps are formed.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Add sugar and stir to combine well. You may notice that the
              mixture has become slightly thinner. Now increase the heat to
              medium-low.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Stir continuously for about 5-7 minutes till it becomes thick.
              It's important to keep stirring to get the perfect texture. Once
              the ghee starts leaving the sides of the mixture and you get the
              right consistency, switch off the heat; otherwise, the burfi will
              be chewy.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >To check the right consistency, take a pinch (it will be hot),
              and roll it. If it forms a ball, then it means the mixture is
              ready to make burfi. Add the cardamom powder and combine
              well.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Transfer the milk powder burfi mixture and spread it evenly on
              the prepared greased tray. We are using a spatula coated with ghee
              to prevent the mixture from sticking to it.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Sprinkle some chopped pistachios and almonds on top for
              garnishing, and press them gently down with a spoon.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Cover the tray using a cling wrap and let them set well for 1-2
              hours. If you are in a hurry, you can also put it in the
              refrigerator for 15-20 minutes to cool down quickly.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Once cooled, take a sharp knife, apply some ghee on it, cut into
              small squares, and enjoy milk powder barfi!</span
